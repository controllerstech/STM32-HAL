# STM32 UART – HAL Examples

This directory contains UART communication examples for STM32 microcontrollers using the HAL driver layer.

The following modes and protocols are included:

- Blocking mode transmit (Part 1)
- Interrupt mode
- DMA mode
- Idle line detection with DMA
- Single-wire (half-duplex) communication
- One-wire protocol
- LIN protocol (Parts 8-10)

Most examples are portable across STM32 families. Tested on:
STM32F103 (F1), STM32F407 (F4), STM32H743 (H7).
